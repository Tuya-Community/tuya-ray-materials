## Laser Sweeper Template

## 1. Usage Notes

- Before using this template for development, you need to have a basic understanding of the Ray framework. It is recommended to first review the [Ray Development Documentation](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp/develop/ray/guide/overview).
- Understand the [SDM Development Method](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp/develop/ray/extended/common/sdm/usage).
- Learn [Vacuum Robot Codelab](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp-codelabs/codelabs/panel-robot-sweeper-guide/index.html#0)

## 2. Quick Start

- [Create a Product](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp/develop/miniapp/guide/start/quick-start#%E4%BA%8C%E5%88%9B%E5%BB%BA%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81)
- [Create a Mini Program](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp/common/desc/platform)

## 3. Development Notes

- IDE development temporarily does not support data transmission through the P2P channel. When developing on the IDE, please install the [Sweeper Debug Assistant](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp/devtools/tools/extension/panel-plugins/dev-sweeper).

  This plugin supports real connections to real sweeper devices and can also simulate data reporting by itself.

- The RjsMap component cannot be debugged with the Sweeper Debug Assistant. Real device debugging is required.
- If you are a new customer, please contact Tuya's project manager to obtain the protocol documentation for the sweeper.

## 5. Map Component

You can view the documentation of the map component by running the following command

```sh
$ npx serve node_modules/@ray-js/robot-map-sdk/dist-docs
```

In terms of map component selection, we provide two modes of components, WebViewMap and RjsMap.

- The WebViewMap component is introduced as a native WebView form as a different layer structure, fill Full Screen by Default. It is a dual-threaded structure independent of the logic layer and view layer of the mini program, providing a better interactive performance experience. Only one can be used in a single mini program page. If you need to overlay view buttons on the WebView, please use it in conjunction with [CoverView](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp/develop/ray/component/view-container/cover-view). For details, you can refer to the examples in the template.

> **Please Note:** **WebViewMap is a native component based on cross-layer rendering. Please read the [Native Component Usage Restrictions](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp/develop/miniapp/component/native-component/native-component) in detail.**

- The RjsMap component is used as an extension of the view layer component in the form of an RJS component, allowing dynamic setting of the component’s width and height. The RjsMap component runs on the same layer as the view element of the mini program. In the case of frequent map data interaction, it may affect the interactive response of view elements. Multiple RjsMap components can be introduced on a single mini program page.
